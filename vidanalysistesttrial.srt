1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:01,840
Speaker #1: Hallow is likely around here somewhere.

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:04,000
Speaker #1: I sense he is close.

3
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:05,880
Speaker #1: Where is he?

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:06,920
Speaker #1: I do not know.

5
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:08,360
Speaker #1: We should look around.

6
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:38,920
Speaker #2: Too afraid to fight back.

7
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,480
Speaker #2: No children.

8
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:42,866
Speaker #2: You fight like a muggle little natsayoni in it and

9
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,200
Speaker #2: they're excruciatingly loyal companion.

10
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:54,166
Speaker #2: You 2 have done quite a bit of damage to

11
00:01:54,253 --> 00:01:59,222
Speaker #2: my business interests, but I must gradually give you some

12
00:01:59,309 --> 00:01:59,919
Speaker #2: credit.

13
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:04,760
Speaker #2: What was once a mere annoyance has become remarkably problematic.

14
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:11,040
Speaker #2: Fortunately, I pride myself on my problem solving skills.

15
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,680
Speaker #2: Come now, you can do better than that.

16
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,960
Speaker #1: Do you really believe that you are so proud?

17
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,040
Speaker #1: Nothing.

18
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:27,880
Speaker #1: No.

19
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:28,080
Speaker #2: Nothing.
