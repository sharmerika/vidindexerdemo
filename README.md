# Azure AI Video Indexer demo


This is a hands-on exploration of **Azure AI Video Indexer**—no code required. Using the portal, I analyzed a short gameplay clip from *Hogwarts Legacy* and observed how AI interprets motion, faces, sentiment, and scenes.

## What It Does

- Uploaded video to Azure Video Indexer Portal
- Generated transcript, scene segmentation, and sentiment mapping
- Detected quirky objects like “motorcycle” and “backpack”... in Hogwarts 
- Exported insights in `.vtt`, `.json`, thumbnails, and a full ZIP bundle

# Notes:
- AI models sometimes mislabel complex or fantastical scenes.
- "motorcycle" and "backpack" were detected in a Hogwarts Legacy clip 🤷‍♀️

##  Reflections
This no-code demo helped me understand how machine learning models behave in cinematic, creative contexts. It’s a reminder that AI can be powerful, fascinating—and sometimes delightfully imperfect.

> This demo didn’t require writing scripts, because it didn’t need to.  
> Azure Video Indexer made the experience intuitive, visual, and fun to explore.  
> (API integration is something I might try next!)
